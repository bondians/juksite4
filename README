This site is meant to work with cocoaJukebox and is called '4' because of the rails version its build on.

Uses rails 4.2.2 ruby 2.2.1

You must have taglib installed in order to use taglib-ruby.
if you don't need it (for the find command specifically) just remove the reference to it from the gemfile.



# some taglib notes:
a= TagLib::FileRef.new("/home/shared/test1.flac")
a= TagLib::MP4::FileRef::.new  ## for mp4s

## specific type, no ref
a= TagLib::MPEG::File::.new  ## for mp3s

a.tag.artist  (e.g.)  # works for everyhting


mp4 stuff
a.tag.item_list_map.to_a     ##lists all the stuff in the tags.. at least for mp4

a.tag.item_list_map.to_a

a.tag.item_list_map['gen'].to_string_list  (e.g. of reading one)  for some reason the copywright symbol comes before 'gen'
