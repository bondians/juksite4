================

This is a web front-end "DJ" that lets users choose songs to play at parties. 
It requires cocoaJukebox.app to actually play the songs, 
and a sqlite3 file/database of all the songs, artists, &c and their locations on disk.

This application was generated with the [rails_apps_composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) gem
provided by the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).
